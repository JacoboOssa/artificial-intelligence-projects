Esto se debe a que el 20 de julio representa el momento en que se rompió simbólicamente con el virreinato español y se inició el camino hacia la autonomía, incluso si la consolidación militar llegó casi una década después. Ambas fechas son fundamentales para entender el proceso independentista colombiano, siendo el 20 de julio la efeméride del *inicio* de ese camino y el 7 de agosto la de su *consumación* militar.\n"
